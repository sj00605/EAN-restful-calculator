# EAN-restful-calculator
A ReSTful calculator that uses express, angular, and node.

The calculator app takes two inputs, then you must choose a arithmetic
operator from the drop down. The hit calculate to see your answer appear!

The unit tests are locating in the unittests folder. The tests use jasmine
as the framework. I used a very simple example of the jasmine framework 
to unit test the http GET and POST. The tests are in the jasmine.html file.
SImply point your browser to that file to see the ouput if the tests. 

The app was built and tested using chrome. There may be errors using other browsers.
